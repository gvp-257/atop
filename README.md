# Average Trap Observation Project (ATOP)

Observe "average" traps in the Taranaki Mounga Project for long periods of time.

## Goals: Answer some Questions about Predators on Maunga Taranaki
1. See what mammals and birds pass by "average" Doc200 traps at selected locations/elevations on the mountain, over the course of years. Do the relative numbers of different target species change over time? Is there a long run secular trend in numbers?
2. Observe interactions with traps, to answer questions like:-
    1. how long after re-baiting does a trap attract target animals?
       1. Does this vary by bait type e.g. fresh rabbit vs rabbit coated in beef dripping vs peanut butter vs goodnature meatlovers' lure.
    3. how many visits does an animal make to the trap before entering? (by species).
    4. after an animal is trapped, do other animals visit? What kinds? When? For how long?
    5. Do we need to change bait cycles and types dynamically over the year? At different elevations?
  
## Metagoals
1. Learn about trail camera operation and maintenance.  Costs, reliability, labour costs, risks.
2. Assess suitability of cheap off-the-shelf trail cameras for long term automatic monitoring of traps in a temperate rainforest environment.

## Constraints

1. Volunteer labour of one person, maybe 1/16 FTE.
2. no funds
